# 'init' is a method written as an entry way to the application. The method is being invoked in 'bin/run' which is an executable file used to initialize the entire program. Please refer to this file if you would like to learn more. 
# When the command './bin/run' is ran in the terminal, it is invoking upon this executable file and running all the code written there.
# The goal of this method is to run subsequent methods that handle different parts and responsibilities of the application in the intended order of operations.
