#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# This line of code is the shebang line. It is beneficial to include this line because this current file does not have an '.rb' extension, which is used to indicate that a Ruby file is being written. This allows the use of './bin/run' instead of 'ruby bin/run'. Because the rest of the code in this file is also written using Ruby methods, it will allow it to be interpreted as such.
