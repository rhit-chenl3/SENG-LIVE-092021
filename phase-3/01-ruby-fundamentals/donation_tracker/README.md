# Ruby Fundamentals

### Lecture Take aways

✅ Methods

✅ Puts

✅ Variables

✅ Conditionals

✅ Arrays

✅ Hashes

✅ Loops

✅ Iteration

✅ Using binding.pry

### Lecture Deliverables

 Create a CLI(command line interface) that will:
  - Greet and prompt users to enter name (puts vs print)
  - Capture and save users entry (gets, chomp, strip, variables)
  - Print a menu of options for user to select from:
    - User can create a new donation
    - See a list of organizations available for donations(iteration, arrays, hashes)
    - Exit program
  - Handle users selection and allow a user to continue using app, looping through the program until exit is selected. (conditionals, loops)
  - Handle user entries that are not valid

### Directions:

1. `cd` into `donations_tracker`
2. In the terminal, run `./bin/run` to start the CLI
3. If the following error message is returned: `zsh: permission denied: ./bin/run`, run the following command: `chmod +x ./bin/run`
