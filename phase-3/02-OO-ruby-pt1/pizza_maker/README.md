# Lecture Exercise

For this exercise, the goal is to create a Pizza class

1. Refactor the application to using classes and object orientation by implementing a Pizza class. 
2. A new pizza instance can be initialized with the following attributes: name, toppings and desc.
3. Refactor code in `cli.rb` to using the class by replacing the pizza hash with a new instance of Pizza, passing in the given values entered by the user. 
3. Add a `binding.pry` after the new pizza instance and run the `.name` method on the object. What is the result? Discuss why this is happening and come up with how to solve the current result, what is missing?
4. Create an instance method in the Pizza class `#details` that will print the name, toppings and desc of the instance the method is invoked upon.
